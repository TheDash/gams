    /**
     * A reference frame type  which handles UTM (between 84/-84 latitude)
     * and UPS coordinates (otherwise). All math is provided by GeographicLib
     * UTMUPS class; this is a wrapper to fit into the GAMS coordinate system
     * architecture.
     *
     * Be sure to use the northing(), easting(), zone(), and hemi() accessors
     * in Position. The base x() and y() values (especially x()) are not
     * traditional UTM representations.
     *
     * Distance calculations with UTMFrame are done two ways:
     *   If the two Positions are in the same zone, a simple cartesian distance
     *   is performed. Otherwise, if this frame is a child to a GPSFrame, the
     *   Positions are converted to that frame, then distance measured according
     *   to the GPSFrame. If neither of the above apply, distance_to is NAN
     *
     * Note: UTM's notion of bearing is not the same as GPS; the y axis does not
     *       necessarily point in the north direction, especially for near-polar
     *       UPS coordinates. For proper transformation of poses, be sure to
     *       transform the entire pose as a single Pose object. Do not transform
     *       Positions and Orientations individually if bearing is important.
