     *    x is Latitude
     *    y is Longitude
     *    z is Altitude (above assumed perfectly spherical surface)
     * Orientations represented in Axis Angle notation
     *    Axis rx points towards north pole
     *    Axis ry points west at current location
     *    Axis rz points upwards (i.e, normal vector)
     *
     * Note that under this scheme, change in x and/or y position, while
     *   maintaining the same orientation angles, implies a orientation relative
     *   to the planet.
     *
     * Distances at same altitude calculated as distance along great circle of
     * sphere of radius planet_radius plus altitude. If altitude differs,
     * great circle distance first calculated using lower of two altitudes,
     * then distance calculated as follows:
     *    distance = sqrt(circle_distance ^ 2 + altitude_difference ^ 2)
     *
     * This frame can have cartesian frames embedded within it, but cannot
     * be embedded within any other frames at this time.

     * Deprecated backwards compatibility aliases. Will be removed in v2
