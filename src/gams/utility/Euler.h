       * applied in an order. The order of orientations, and whether they are
       * applied to axes that follow the object as it orients, or stay fixed
       * throughout, are the Euler convention. The template parameters of
       * this class template specify the convention, using type tags from the
       * "conv" namespace.
       *
       * There are typedefs for all supported conventions provided for
       * convenience. In particular, EulerVREP, and YawPitchRoll may be of
       * most common utility.
       *
       * Each convention requires specific support in the code. See
       * EulerFormulas.inl for implementation details. If you use an unsupported
       * convention, you will get a compile time error.
       *
       * Avoid manipulating angles in this notation. It is better to convert to
       * a Quaternion (or Orientation) and back, than to try to directly manipulate
       * a Euler angle.
