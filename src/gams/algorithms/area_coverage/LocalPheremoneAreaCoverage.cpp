 * Agents mark a sensor with their time when they enter a discretized cell of a 
 * region. At each time step, they select the neighboring cell with the lowest 
 * pheremone reading as their next destination.
 *
 * NOTE: the Area Coverage algorithms currently use the deprecated
 * utility::Position classes, and should not be used as examples.
 *
 * Disabled pending repair of the variables::Sensor class
